Membership Operator
Operator         Description                                      Example
  in             return true if the value is present               x in y 
not in           return false if the value is not present         x not in y

Identity Operator
Operator         Description                                              Example
  is             return true if both variables are the same obeject       x is y         // is same as equle to (=)
 is not          return true if both variables are the same obeject       x is not y     // is not same as not equal to (1=)

Bitwise Operator
Operator         Description          Example
  &                AND                 x & y
  |                OR                  x | y
  ^                XOR                 x ^ y      only one condition true than return true, if both are true than return false, if both are false than return false
